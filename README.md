# russian_airtraffic_case_study
The core reason this task is being undertaken is for the Russian Airspace Control to have an improved understanding of the traffic flows for the airports scattered across Russia.
As a data analyst, I've been tasked with analysing the data at hand and providing key trends/insights back to Management with an view on which airports are the most busy/idle. The core reason Management is interested in this is that they have recently started developing 'Virus Action Plans" and wants to better understand which airports will likely have the most traffic over time.
